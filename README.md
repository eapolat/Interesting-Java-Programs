# Interesting-Java-Programs
Here we have three different and interesting Java programs: Distribution of jars, special and super special tests.

Distribution of jars take both number of large jars and order, then calculate and distribute them into small jars. So it will show how many small jars needed check if we have enough small jars.

Special test takes a word and check if it is a special word. And test the distances between middle, first and last characters. 

Super special test takes a word and a character to check it by calculating the distances between that character and middle, first, last characters in the word.

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
